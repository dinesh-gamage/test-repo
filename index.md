# Welcome

Welcome to the Lucy Experience Portal!

The experience portal part of Lucy allows you to deliver rich analytics and user journeys to your customers.

This site contains documentation on the experience portal toolkit and is targetted at developers who want to build interfaces for the portal.

## Requirements

The Experience Portal toolkit is based on [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org) so you should have some familiarity with these technologies to get started.

You will need the following to get started:

* Windows, macOS or Linux
* Node.js (10+) installed

Visual Studio Code works really well as an editor for building your solution.
