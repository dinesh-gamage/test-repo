# User Interface Types

Developers can contribute 3 types of user interfaces to the experience portal.

1. Widgets
2. Sidebar Links (and associated UIs when a link is invoked)
3. Page Components


## Widgets
Widgets are small cards that can appear on a dashbaord.
When you publish a widget, it becomes available in the general widget gallery and users can choose to select and add the widget to their dashboard.

Each widget can be added multiple times. Depending on your requirements, widgets can be resized and dragged around


## Sidebar Links
When you publish a sidebar link, the link is available in the Lucy Experience Portal configuration section. When a new portal screen is being configured, the administrator user can choose to add one or more sidebar links to the portal.

These links show up in the portal's sidebar.
They can invoke arbitrary javascript or (more likely) invoke some UI element- like a modal dialog.

## Page Components
These are react components that can be displayed as a full-page user interface.
