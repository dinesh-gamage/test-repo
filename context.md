# UXP Context Object

All UIs have access to a context object that lets them interact with the environment.

The context lets you execute Lucy model actions, check authorization and application roles and retrieve information about the current user, among other things.

In widgets and sidebar components, the component's `props` contain an item called `uxpContext` which points to the current context.
