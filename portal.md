#Understanding the Experience Portal
The Experience Portal is a feature of Lucy that lets you define custom user interfaces for end-users.

Your user interface can consist of dashboards and widgets, sidebars, dialogs and other content.

You can define multiple portals within Lucy for different types of users and for different kinds of interactions.


Here are some examples of portal screens you can define in Lucy:

* A dashboard screen that shows user-selectable widgets that can be arranged and customized
* A end-user portal that users can login to and perform select actions and get feedback
* A general data entry form to collect feedback
* A configuration screen

The core skeleton of the interface is provided by Lucy. You can contribute content in the form of widgets, sidebar links, and other custom UI pages and dialogs.
